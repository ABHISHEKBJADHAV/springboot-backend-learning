Blob in Angular
@Lob, @RequestPart in Spring
MultiPartFile in Spring

Why Use Blob?
Because FormData.append() expects either a string, a file, or a Blob.
Wrapping JSON in a Blob ensures it’s treated as a separate part in the multipart request — exactly what your backend expects with @RequestPart Product.

auto-commit error while returning large objects. While returning LOB(Large Objects) operations. While reading byte[] image from @Lob
One application property to fix that

DTO - Data Transfer Object
When we want to send a data to client (Not directly Entity i.e. table) and back from client we need DTO

records in Java - 
public record Product(String name, double price) {}

@Entity(name = "orders")
@FetchType

Relations - 

1. One-to-One (@OneToOne)
Definition: One entity is associated with exactly one other entity.
Example: Each User has one Profile.

@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToOne
    private Profile profile;
}


2. One-to-Many (@OneToMany)
Definition: One entity is associated with many other entities.
Example: A Category has many Products.

@Entity
public class Category {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "category")
    private List<Product> products;
}

@Entity
public class Product {
    @ManyToOne
    private Category category;
}



3. Many-to-One (@ManyToOne)
Definition: Many entities are associated with one entity.
Example: Many Orders belong to one Customer. Also you can refer above Product example.

@Entity
public class Order {
    @ManyToOne
    private Customer customer;
}


4. Many-to-Many (@ManyToMany)
Definition: Many entities are associated with many other entities.
Example: A Student can enroll in many Courses, and each Course can have many Students.

@Entity
public class Student {
    @ManyToMany
    private List<Course> courses;
}

@Entity
public class Course {
    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = "courses")
    private List<Student> students;
}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "order", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<OrderItem> orderItems;


@Entity(name = "Orders")
public class Order {

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)    
    private List<OrderItem> orderItems;
}

// Here note that 'o' is small of "order" because it refers to the exact field name in the OrderItem class
