Observable:

An Observable is a way to handle asynchronous data streams — data that arrives over time, not all at once.

Observable vs Promise (key difference):

| Feature                 | Observable         | Promise     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| Values                  | Multiple           | Single      |
| Lazy execution          | ✅                 | ❌         |
| Cancelable              | ✅ (unsubscribe)   | ❌         |
| Operators               | map, filter, retry | then, catch |
| Used heavily in Angular | ✅                 | ❌         |

👉 Promise = one-time result
👉 Observable = continuous stream



Think of authentication as two layers:
| Layer                         | Responsibility                                     |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Angular (Frontend)**        | UI access control (who can see which page)         |
| **Spring Security (Backend)** | API access control (who can access which endpoint) |

👉 Angular Auth Guard ≠ Security
👉 Spring Security = Real Security

Angular prevents navigation, Spring prevents API access.
