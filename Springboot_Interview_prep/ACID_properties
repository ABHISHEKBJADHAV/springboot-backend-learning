ACID Properties (Database Transactions)

ACID ensures that a transaction is processed reliably.

1️⃣ A – Atomicity

Meaning:
Transaction is all or nothing.

Example:
You transfer ₹1000 from Account A to B.
	•	Debit A ✔️
	•	Credit B ❌ (failed)

Then Debit A is rolled back → No partial update.

Either both happen or none happen.

⸻

2️⃣ C – Consistency

Meaning:
After transaction, database must be in a valid state.

Example:
If rule is: Total balance of bank = constant

After money transfer, total balance remains same → consistent state

No rule violation allowed.

⸻

3️⃣ I – Isolation

Meaning:
Multiple transactions execute independently.

Example:
While you are transferring money, another user checking balance
should not see half-completed data.

They either see:
	•	before transaction
	•	or after transaction
not in between

⸻

4️⃣ D – Durability

Meaning:
Once committed, data is permanently saved.

Example:
After successful transfer, even if power fails, data is safe.
