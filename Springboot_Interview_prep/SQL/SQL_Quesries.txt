INSERT INTO students (id, name, age, department)
VALUES (1, 'Rahul', 21, 'IT');

SELECT * FROM students;

UPDATE students
SET department = 'Data Science'
WHERE id = 1;

DELETE FROM students
WHERE id = 3;



🔹 SELECT + WHERE:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age > 20;

🔹 ORDER BY:
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY name ASC;

🔹 LIMIT / OFFSET (pagination):
SELECT name FROM students ORDER BY name LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1;

🔹 LIKE:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE name LIKE 'A%';

🔹 IN / BETWEEN:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE grade IN ('A','B');

🔹 GROUP BY + HAVING (VERY IMPORTANT):
SELECT department, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

Interview trap:
❌ WHERE COUNT(*) > 5 → wrong
✅ HAVING COUNT(*) > 5


SELECT name FROM students ORDER BY name LIMIT (SELECT COUNT(*) - 2 FROM students) OFFSET 1;
