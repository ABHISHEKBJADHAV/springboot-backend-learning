Questions from multiple interviews...

*Scenario* : You have a large application with hundreds of Spring beans. One day, a new developer accidentally creates two beans of the same type.
*Q* : How will Spring handle this situation, and how can you resolve bean conflict in such scenarios?

*Scenario* : You want to create a singleton bean that behaves differently for each user session.
*Q* : How can you configure a Spring bean to be session-scoped in a web application?

*Scenario* : A service class has three dependencies. One is required, and two are optional.
*Q* : How will you inject dependencies such that the service still works if optional dependencies are missing?

*Scenario* : A user submits a form, but you want to validate the input at the controller layer and return custom error messages without showing a generic 500 error.
*Q* : How can you handle form validation and custom error display in Spring MVC?

*Scenario* : You want to pass data from a controller to a JSP page.
*Q* : What are the differences between Model, ModelMap, and ModelAndView? Which one will you use and why?

*Scenario* : You want to handle different versions of an API like /api/v1/users and /api/v2/users.
*Q* : How do you manage versioning in Spring MVC?

*Scenario* : Your application has different user roles – ADMIN and USER. Some endpoints must be accessible only to admins.
*Q* : How will you implement role-based access control in Spring Security?

*Scenario* : You want to store a JWT token on the frontend and validate it on each request.
*Q* : How will you configure Spring Security to work with JWT-based stateless authentication?

*Scenario* : Your application works fine locally but fails on deployment with a port conflict.
*Q* : How can you configure dynamic or environment-based port management in Spring Boot?

*Scenario* : You want to monitor the health, metrics, and status of your Spring Boot app.
*Q* : What tools or features in Spring Boot can help with application monitoring and health checks?

*Scenario* : Your microservice depends on a downstream service that sometimes goes down.
*Q* : How will you use Spring Cloud or Spring Boot features to handle failures gracefully?

*Scenario* : You want to write unit tests for a service class without loading the full application context.
*Q* : How can you test Spring components efficiently using mocks?

*Scenario* : You have multiple profiles (dev, test, prod).
*Q* : How will you test code under different profiles using Spring?

*Scenario* : A query is taking too long, and you suspect it is due to fetching too much data.
*Q* : How can you optimize your repository method using @Query and fetch strategies?

*Scenario* : You need to create a dynamic query based on optional search parameters.
*Q* : How will you implement this using Spring Data JPA?


HCL First Round:

self introduction

thread in how many ways to create 

exceptions checked and unchecked how to handle in spring boot local & global

functional interface and lambda with code example

input int val = 12340000; output 1234

String val = "abcaabca"; --> frequent accurance

create integer array and sort in desc using streams

few more questions in collections
