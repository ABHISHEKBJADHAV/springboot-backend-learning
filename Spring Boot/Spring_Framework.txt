Object: Any instance of a class created in Java using the new keyword or similar. Manged by programmer.
Bean: An object managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. Managed by Spring.	

ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
or
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
Basically this is IOC container and when we create that at that time only bean is created.
When scope is singleton(default scope) then While container loading at that time only bean created but when scope is prototype then it not creates bean while loading IOC container.

DI(Dependency Injection): Laptop class is depends on CPU class. Both objects/Beans would be in IOC container. Need to use DI to inject that.
Conventionally we do - 
class Laptop {
    private CPU cpu = new CPU(); // Hard-coded
}

With Spring and DI It's - 
@Component
class Laptop {
    private CPU cpu;

    @Autowired
    public Laptop(CPU cpu) { // Constructor injection
        this.cpu = cpu;
    }
}

@Component
class CPU {}
